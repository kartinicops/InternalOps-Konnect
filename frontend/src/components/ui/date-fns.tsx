// This file is typically not needed as date-fns is a third-party library.
// Instead, you would install it via npm or yarn:
// npm install date-fns
// or
// yarn add date-fns

// Then you can import it in your components like this:
// import { format } from 'date-fns'

// For the sake of this example, we'll create a dummy export:
export const format = (date: Date, formatString: string): string => {
    // This is a very simplified version and doesn't actually format the date
    return date.toDateString();
  }
